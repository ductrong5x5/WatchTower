https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/Watchtower/issues/16

### What you did not do
I wrote all I set out to do, but I did write a some sloppy code at points so I will need to rewrite at some point.

### What problems you encountered
Generally just using Rust

### Issues you worked on

### Files you worked on
- /Watchtower/watchtower-senser/src/os/linux.rs

### What you accomplished
So I accomplished getting the total ram and ram usage data and printed it out to console. Additionally, I got the CPU core count and CPU usage and wrote it to console. Finally, I checked if the device had a battery, and I printed out the battery percentage.

# Sprint 1 
Ryan Franqui, RJFranqui, Watchtower
# What I planned to do
- Learn basic web development with HTML, CSS, and JS. With this done I hoped to make a basic website template for the group
- Make an about us section to reinforce the skills I had learned this sprint 
- Make a graph
- I would still like to expand the about us section, I need some more photos of my group mates and some basic info about them
- I still want to experiment with updating the graphs with constat numbers so that the page becomes more dynamic looking 
- Hook it all up with react 
- Just making it all look nicer
# Problems 
- The biggest headache was learning formatting with CSS and to be honest, it still needs to be ironed out

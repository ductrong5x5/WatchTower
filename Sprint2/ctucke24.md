# Sprint 2 Reflection
Clayton Tucker

## What you planned to do

Work on the network and Gpu data collection for the linux sensor

## What you did not do

I did not get the network function done

## What problems you encountered

- I was having issues running the code to test. The way that Clayton Gilmer set up the file structure made it so that an error code was thrown  and then imediately quit if there was an issue with the function.

## Issues you worked on

- https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/Watchtower/issues/32
- https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/Watchtower/issues/31 (incomplete)


## Files you worked on

- https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/Watchtower/blob/sprint2/watchtower-sensor/src/os/linux.rs

## What you accomplished

I beleive that I have got the GPU functions working and one of the network functions. However, i was having trouble testing my code so I am unsure if it actually works. If it doesnt, it will be some very minor bugs.

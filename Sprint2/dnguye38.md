### What you accomplished
(Give a description of the features you added or tasks you accomplished. Provide some detail here. This section will be a little longer than the bulleted lists above) 
- By finishing the UI, I have more time to work with html and MySQL. This may takes a little bit time since this is the first time I work with my SQL, but I think it will be ok. The hardest part may be how can I getting data from MySQL database continously and update the data in html and frontend app.

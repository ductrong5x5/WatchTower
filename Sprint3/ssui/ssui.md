### Files you worked on
- *Watchtower/backend/app.py*
- *Watchtower/backend/db.py*

### What you accomplished
The backend is primarily finished until new features are added or needed to support other areas. The backend successfully parses and processes the sensors' JSON packages and is able to send that data to the SQL server. This data is further available for the frontend to use for visualizations or display.

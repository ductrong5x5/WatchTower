### What you accomplished
- Now I know many things that I didn't know before taking this class. I know how to setup SQL Database, connect to the database, fetching data, coding with php and python, using Pyqt for UI.
  This class is awesome. For the project, now I just need to do a couple testing and check some errors of files. We basically finish it.
